# RISC-V Summit North America 2023 (Santa Clara)
## Introduction
This a 3-day event from 6th to 8th Nov. The first day was the member-only event while the rest were more focus on marketing, general introduction, demo, poster and socalization. Almost all sessions were less than 30-min, so not much of deep technical ones. Since Qualcomm is the sponsor of the organziation, I was able to attend the member-only events.

## Day-1
I was late for the RISC-V 101 due to public transportation hiccups. This was a great half-day introduction sessions for RISC-V beginners. One of the sessions was about the point of entry for companies to get access to RISC-V technology:
- RISC-V exchange: a official marketplace for hardware, software, services and trainings.
- OpenHW group: open-source cores related offerings.
- RISE (RISC-V Software Ecosystem): open-source software for RISC-V
- Vendor-specific sites like Green Hills for Software, Andres as a core provider, and Microchip as a silicon provider.

The next session talked about "Buy vs Make" mindset when coming to RISC-V.
